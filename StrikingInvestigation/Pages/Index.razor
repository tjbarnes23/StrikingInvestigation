    <h1>Striking Investigation</h1>

    <br />

    <p style="max-width: 800px">
        This website lets ringers specify when their bell should strike following a series of blows with
        striking errors.
        The aim is to determine whether ringers generally agree on the correct point in time to strike a bell
        when the preceding blows are not evenly struck.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width: 800px">
        There are also two other tests:
    </p>

    <ul style="max-width: 800px">
        <li class="mb-3">
            An A/B test to determine how small a striking error ringers can detect; and
        </li>

        <li>
            An A/V test to see if ringers respond to audio and visual cues in the same way.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p style="max-width: 800px">
        <u>Select Gap:</u> This allows a user to create a block of rows with random striking errors,
        and then specify where their bell (the last bell) should strike.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p style="max-width: 800px">
        <u>A/B Test:</u> The same block of rows is played twice, once with errors and once without.
        The user attempts to detect which block has the errors.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p style="max-width: 800px">
        <u>A/V Test:</u> A bell will be heard to strike, and a visual representation of the strike
        will appear on the screen. The user adjusts the position of the bell on the screen until
        the audio and visual components are sensed at the same time.
